# Problem Description 

## Fetch information from the server.

## Implementation 1 : 

Using the api provided on <https://pokeapi.co/> build an application that shows a list of all the pokemon characters and their pictures with a nice looking UI. 

When a pokemon character is clicked it should lead to a page with full details of the character pulled from the appropriate endpoint with all images, move, abilities, stats etc showing at different sections. 

### Expectation: 

-   Show appropriate information for appropriate endpoint 

-   Your app should not crash when network is turned off 

-   I should be able to set the limit of information I wish to see

### Implementation 2:

Using livedata and or rxjava, your project should react live to network change without closing or opening the app i.e if I turn off and turn it on back I shouldn’t have to click a button to refresh
